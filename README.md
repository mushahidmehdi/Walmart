# Walmart_Sale_Forcast_Tutorial
This project describe sale prediction given the dataset for Walmart Inc. 

The Data from Walmart stores accross the US is given from Febuary 2010 to July 2012, and our job as data scientist is to forecast their weekly sales.
Sounds pretty cool right!
The data is already split into a four CSVs training, test store and features dataset and we want to fit a model that will be able to predict the future sale, as
accurate as possible.

I tried my best to make things simple as possible and write this jupyter text in tutorial form, so anyone can easily get along.
We will start at looking at the data first and there we will twist and turn the featurs as we need them. 
There is alot to explain becauase the data is quite messy and to make it feedable for the model will take some pretty solid understanding of pandas.
I would also like to mention, the content in this tuturial, espically customize graph function has been builded on kaggle competetion, to make things smooth and
handy to undertand. 
So without a further due let's hope in.
